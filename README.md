# Starting Lineup

Starting Lineup is a football lineup app which allows the user to edit and display their desired formation, player names, player numbers numbers, shirt type (striped, hooped etc), shirt colour and the colour of the shirt numbers. I built this app to demonstrate to potential employers my capabilities and also to gain experience of using React, Tailwind CSS & SVG's alongside each other. Whilst building this, I encountered several issues along the way, the main being how I could ensure the shirts were customisable. This issue was circumvented by using SVG’s however they were quite a learning curb in themselves, ensuring they could interact with React / CSS and how they. In the future I would implement the ability to drag players into different positions so that the user can build non con-standard football formations. I’d also find a way for the app to hold two formations simulatenously, one for attacking and one for defending, along with the capacity to save these formations for future use.
